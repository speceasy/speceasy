    <releaseNotes>
Version 2.1.0 of SpecEasy includes:
  - Prevent exceptions in the method under test from being ignored when there is also an assertion failure. See https://github.com/trackabout/speceasy/pull/24.
  - Added the ability to detect and use non-public constructors when constructing the SUT.
  - Enable the testing of abstract classes.
  - Support for .NET 4.5 in addition to the existing .NET 4.5.1 support.
  - Include spec method names as prefix for test case description.
  - Added `And` and `But` spec context methods. These methods set up context identically to the original `Given` methods but are provided as a way to improve readability.
  - Several other minor fixes and improvements.
